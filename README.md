# nic.edu.pl
a placeholder website in place of polands' educational registry (NIC)

### there should definitely be legal concerns with this, right?
uhh, *<sup>likely</sup>* *<sup>ⁿᵒᵗ??</sup>* <br>
it expired 4 days prior to writing this <br>
and it was used as a temporary .edu email. there was seemingly never an actual registry there <br>

## the catch
this domain has the highest amount of tld<sub>s</sub> it was registered under [**1.5k**], <br>
and nothing else even comes close. <br>
the closest one seems to be "com" with **743** tld<sub>s</sub> <br>
the rest of the top 10 for comparison: <br>
